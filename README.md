### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- React Icons

### What I learned

This one, took me longer than I thought it would. I worked on and off on it in the span of a week. I feel like it took me longer than I expected. However, like always I can't help but feel pride in my work. I think I had a good work, life balance, and didn't cram it all in one or two days. Better future planning will be more helpful. I'll be honest by towards the end I was so over it, I think i'll be tricking myself in the fututre and making the footer section first hahahaaa.
I think I did excellent use of React by breaking the whole page into sections. Shoot, come to think of it I even used props!

### Continued development

Better time management, better use of the technologies available in the world wide web first get to know react tools, and it's libraries.
